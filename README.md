# Simple proxy checkign script

This script was used while reachsearching for [this blog entry](https://blog.haschek.at/post/fd854)

I do not provide a proxy list you have to create it yourself. Just name it ```proxylist_http.txt``` for your HTTP proxies or ```proxylist_socks.txt``` for SOCKS proxies.

Every line must be one ip:port combination like: 192.168.0.5:3128
